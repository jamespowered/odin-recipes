        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I've used the combination of pork, beef, and veal but you can make them with just ground beef and they still taste great.</p>
        <p>Definitely use fresh bread crumbs and freshly grate your cheese instead of using the canned variety... It really does make a difference!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground meat</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Italian bread</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the first eight ingredients in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the bread crumbs and slowly add the water.</li>
            <li>Shape the mixture into meatballs.</li>
            <li>Fry the meatballs until they're all brown and crisp.</li>
        </ol>
